              The first public recognition of Adam Skoumal as a composer occurred in the Prague Spring Competition 1998, when his playing of his own composition won a special prize for the best performance of a Czech contemporary piece. In 2006, he premiered his First Piano Concerto with the Prague Philharmonia and he also played his Second Piano Concerto with the Chamber Philharmonic Orchestra of South Bohemia in the same year. In the spring 2008, Shlomo Mintz premiered Skoumal's composition for violin and piano called "Djinnia" in Dubrovnik. Since then, Mr.Mintz has played the piece several times on his tour through South America and also in Rome and Milano in Italy. The orchestral version of Djinnia was performed in 2013 by Jiří Bělohlávek with Prague Philharmonia and broadcasted live on Czech TV. Another violin composition, "Variations on a Gypsy Melody", was chosen to be an obligatory piece in the International Violin Competition in Sion, Switzerland in 2009, as well as the First International Violin Competition in Buenos Aires, Argentina 2010.
